# Mobile App Progress

## Session 4 — 2026-05-19

### Completed This Session

**Date Range Filtering — Journal Entries**
- Added collapsible date filter panel (📅 button in header toggles it)
- Text inputs for `from` and `to` dates (YYYY-MM-DD format) with green/red validation feedback
- **Quick date presets**: Today, This Week, This Month, Last Month — one tap to set the range
- Active filter indicator (●) shown on the toggle button when dates are set
- Clear button to reset dates
- Dates are passed to the API (`from`, `to` params) for server-side filtering

**Search in Accounts Payable & Accounts Receivable**
- **AP Bills tab**: search by bill number, vendor name, or status
- **AP Vendors tab**: search by vendor name
- **AR Invoices tab**: search by invoice number, customer name, or status
- **AR Customers tab**: search by customer name
- All searches update the record count in the section header

**Search in Purchase Orders & Sales Orders**
- **Purchase Orders**: search bar filters by PO number, vendor name, or status
- **Sales Orders**: search bar filters by SO number, customer name, or status
- Search clears to show all records, empty state shows appropriate message

**GRN → PO Detail Navigation**
- GRN cards are now tappable — tap opens the full PO detail screen
- "Tap to view PO detail →" affordance shown on each card
- More items line updated to "...tap to view all"

**Back Button Polish — All Non-Root Screens**
- Added `BackButton` component to all screens accessible from MoreMenu and FinanceMenu:
  - Materials, Purchase Orders, Sales Orders, GRN, Partners, Companies
  - Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Journal Entries, Trial Balance, Financial Reports
- All three screens missing `flexDirection: 'row'` in header (AP, AR, Financial Reports) were fixed
- `BackButton` uses `canGoBack()` internally — won't appear on root screens

## Session 3 — 2026-05-18

### Completed This Session

**Global Company Filter (extended)**
- Wired `CompanyPicker` + `useCompany()` into **Dashboard**, **Materials**, **Journal Entries**, **Partners**, and **Sales Orders** screens — all list data now filters by the globally selected company
- `TrialBalance` and `FinancialReports` now pull companies from `CompanyContext` instead of fetching independently (eliminates redundant `/api/options/companies` calls)
- Fixed `CompanyContext` to reload companies **after login** instead of failing silently on app start (root cause: provider was mounting before auth token was available)

**API Reliability**
- `src/api/client.ts` — added exponential-backoff retry (2 attempts, 500ms/1000ms delays) for network errors and HTTP 5xx/429 responses

**Navigation & UX Polish**
- `MoreMenuScreen`: removed disabled Finance items (were showing "Available in Finance tab" lock icons); replaced with tappable items that navigate directly into Finance tab's screens via `getParent()`
- `AppStack`: removed dead duplicate routes (Inventory, Materials, PurchaseOrders, PODetail) that were shadowing the real screens in the tab navigators
- Fixed Inventory tab icon bug: icon key was `InventoryTab` but route name is `Inventory` — tab was showing `•` instead of `🏭`
- `PurchaseOrder` type: added `received` and `receipt_pct` optional fields for the `progress` view response

**Documentation**
- Updated `scripts/generate-docs.js` with Session 3 changelog and updated Section 3/Section 4
- Regenerated `FEATURES.docx`
