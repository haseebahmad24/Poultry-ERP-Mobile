### Completed This Session

  - Empty state with optional clear-filter CTA

**Offline Data Caching**
- Installed `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
- `src/utils/cache.ts`: `getCached` / `setCached` with 24h TTL and version key
- `src/components/OfflineBanner.tsx`: amber "showing cached data" banner component
- `DashboardScreen`: serves cached KPIs/vouchers instantly on mount, fetches fresh in background; shows `OfflineBanner` if network fails and cached data exists
- `InventoryScreen`: caches stock balances per company; populates UI from cache immediately then refreshes silently

## Session 4 — 2026-05-19

### Completed This Session

- More items line updated to "...tap to view all"

**Back Button Polish — All Non-Root Screens**

  - Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Journal Entries, Trial Balance, Financial Reports
- All three screens missing `flexDirection: 'row'` in header (AP, AR, Financial Reports) were fixed
- `BackButton` uses `canGoBack()` internally — won't appear on root screens

---

## Session 3 — 2026-05-18

### Completed This Session

**Global Company Filter (extended)**
- Wired `CompanyPicker` + `useCompany()` into **Dashboard**, **Materials**, **Journal Entries**, **Partners**, and **Sales Orders** screens — all list data now filters by the globally selected company
- `TrialBalance` and `FinancialReports` now pull companies from `CompanyContext` instead of fetching independently (eliminates redundant `/api/options/companies` calls)
- Fixed `CompanyContext` to reload companies **after login** instead of failing silently on app start (root cause: provider was mounting before auth token was available)

**API Reliability**
- `src/api/client.ts` — added exponential-backoff retry (2 attempts, 500ms/1000ms delays) for network errors and HTTP 5xx/429 responses

**Navigation & UX Polish**
- `MoreMenuScreen`: removed disabled Finance items (were showing "Available in Finance tab" lock icons); replaced with tappable items that navigate directly into Finance tab's screens via `getParent()`
- `AppStack`: removed dead duplicate routes (Inventory, Materials, PurchaseOrders, PODetail) that were shadowing the real screens in the tab navigators
- Fixed Inventory tab icon bug: icon key was `InventoryTab` but route name is `Inventory` — tab was showing `•` instead of `🏭`
- `PurchaseOrder` type: added `received` and `receipt_pct` optional fields for the `progress` view response

**Documentation**
- Updated `scripts/generate-docs.js` with Session 3 changelog and updated Section 3/Section 4
- Regenerated `FEATURES.docx`
